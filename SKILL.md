# Independence Audit

Analyze a situation to identify where adults are over-helping, creating dependency rather than capability, and recommend how to step back.

---

## When to Use

- "Am I helping too much?"
- "How do I make them more independent?"
- "Why are they so dependent on me?"
- "They won't do anything for themselves"
- Anytime a helper feels indispensable
- When learned helplessness seems present

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | What tasks or areas involve helping/dependency |
| learner_profile | Yes | Age and capabilities of the person being helped |
| current_help | No | What the adult currently does for the learner |
| struggles | No | Where the learner struggles or gives up |
| concerns | No | Adult worries about reducing help |

---

## The Core Principle

**"Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed."**

Every unnecessary assistance is an obstacle to development. The helper's instinct to make things easier often makes things worse - creating dependency, eroding confidence, and robbing the learner of the satisfaction of mastery.

**Montessori's insight:** The child's deepest words are "Help me to do it alone."

---

## The Three Types of Help

### 1. Necessary Help (Keep)

Help the learner cannot yet do without:
- Physical limitations (genuinely cannot reach, lift, manipulate)
- Safety requirements (genuine danger)
- Skills not yet acquired (cannot be expected at this developmental stage)

**Test:** Would the learner fail or be harmed without this help?

### 2. Enabling Help (Modify)

Help that could become unnecessary with environmental or instructional changes:
- Task too complex (could be broken into smaller steps)
- Environment not prepared (materials not accessible)
- Skill not yet taught (hasn't been shown how)

**Test:** Could a modification allow the learner to do this independently?

### 3. Disabling Help (Remove)

Help the learner could do without, but has become dependent on:
- Convenience for the adult ("It's faster if I just do it")
- Anxiety ("What if they fail/get hurt/feel bad?")
- Habit (always done it this way)
- Underestimation (assuming they can't when they can)

**Test:** Could the learner do this if forced to? Have they done it before?

---

## The Independence Audit Process

### Step 1: List All Current Help

For the area of concern, catalog everything the adult does for the learner:
- Physical tasks (dressing, feeding, cleaning)
- Cognitive tasks (deciding, planning, remembering)
- Emotional tasks (soothing, motivating, regulating)
- Social tasks (speaking for them, arranging interactions)

### Step 2: Assess Learner Capability

For each type of help, ask:
- What is developmentally appropriate at this age?
- What has this learner demonstrated they CAN do?
- What could they do with a modification?
- What do we assume they can't do without evidence?

### Step 3: Categorize Each Help Instance

For each item on the list:
- Is this NECESSARY help (genuine limitation)?
- Is this ENABLING help (modifiable)?
- Is this DISABLING help (could be removed)?

### Step 4: Identify the Adult Obstacle

For disabling help, identify why the adult continues:
- Fear of failure ("They'll make a mess")
- Time pressure ("It takes too long")
- Perfectionism ("They won't do it right")
- Emotional discomfort ("They'll be upset")
- Identity ("They need me")

### Step 5: Design the Transition

For each item to modify or remove:
- What environmental change would help?
- What skill needs to be taught?
- What is the first step toward independence?
- What will the adult do instead of helping?

## The Montessori Response to "They Can't"

| Adult Says | Montessori Asks |
|------------|-----------------|
| "They can't do it" | "Have they been shown how?" |
| "They always fail" | "Is the task appropriate? Is the environment prepared?" |
| "They give up" | "Is the challenge graduated appropriately?" |
| "They need me" | "What would happen if you stepped back?" |
| "It's easier if I do it" | "Easier for whom?" |
| "They'll make a mess" | "Can the mess be part of the learning?" |
| "They're too young" | "What CAN they do at this age?" |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

### Situation Summary
[Brief description of the dependency concern]

### Help Inventory

| Task/Area | Current Adult Help | Learner Could... | Category |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| [task] | [what adult does] | [potential] | Necessary/Enabling/Disabling |

### Analysis

**Disabling help identified:**
1. [Help that should be removed]
   - Adult justification: [why they continue]
   - Evidence learner could manage: [what shows capability]

**Enabling help that could be modified:**
1. [Help that needs modification]
   - Current obstacle: [what prevents independence]
   - Modification needed: [environmental or instructional change]

### Adult Obstacles to Address
[What fears, habits, or beliefs are preventing the adult from stepping back?]

### Transition Plan

**Immediate (this week):**
1. [Specific step to reduce one area of disabling help]
2. [Environmental modification to enable independence]

**Short-term (next month):**
1. [Skill to teach that would enable independence]
2. [Next area to address once first succeeds]

**Adult behavior change:**
- Instead of: [current over-help]
- Do: [replacement behavior]

### Expect and Accept
[Normal struggles/messes/failures that should be allowed as part of the process]

### Signs of Success
- [Indicator that independence is increasing]
- [What to watch for]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not push independence faster than development allows
- Acknowledge genuine limitations without assuming incapability
- Address adult anxiety as a real obstacle, not a character flaw
- Expect temporary regression before progress
- Value the process over the outcome (a messy attempt is better than adult completion)

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "My 6-year-old can't get ready for school without me standing over him the whole time. I have to remind him of every step - get dressed, brush teeth, pack bag. If I don't, nothing happens. How do I make him more independent?"

**Output:**

## Independence Audit

### Situation Summary
A 6-year-old requires constant adult prompting for morning routine. Parent feels the child cannot initiate or complete routine tasks independently.

### Help Inventory

| Task/Area | Current Adult Help | Learner Could... | Category |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Getting dressed | Verbal reminders for each step | Choose and put on clothes independently | Disabling |
| Brushing teeth | Reminder to start and finish | Complete with visual checklist | Enabling |
| Packing bag | Parent packs or heavily prompts | Pack with consistent storage system | Enabling |
| Sequencing | Parent announces each step | Follow visual routine chart | Enabling |
| Starting | Parent initiates every task | Respond to external cue (music, timer) | Enabling |

### Analysis

**Disabling help identified:**
1. **Verbal reminders for dressing**
   - Adult justification: "He just stands there if I don't tell him"
   - Evidence learner could manage: At 6, dressing is developmentally appropriate. He knows HOW to dress. The issue is initiation and sequence, not capability.

**Enabling help that could be modified:**
1. **No visual routine support**
   - Current obstacle: Child must remember sequence from memory or adult voice
   - Modification: Create visual morning routine chart showing sequence

2. **Bag packing lacks system**
   - Current obstacle: Items scattered, no consistent location
   - Modification: Create "launch pad" by door where bag lives, with checklist inside bag

3. **No independent start cue**
   - Current obstacle: Child depends on adult to signal "time to start"
   - Modification: Morning music playlist that signals routine start

### Adult Obstacles to Address

**Time pressure:** "We'll be late if I don't keep him moving"
- Reality: Current system is creating dependency that perpetuates slowness
- Reframe: Short-term investment in independence = long-term time savings

**Confirmation bias:** "He can't do it without me"
- Reality: He has never been given the chance to fail and self-correct
- Reframe: How do you know he can't if you've never stopped prompting?

### Transition Plan

**Immediate (this week):**
1. **Create visual routine chart** together with him. Photos of each step in order: clothes, teeth, bag, shoes. Post at his eye level.
2. **Establish start cue:** Morning playlist begins at 7:00. When music plays, routine begins. Adult does not verbally prompt.

**Short-term (next month):**
1. **Remove yourself physically:** Once chart is established, be in a different room during routine. Available if asked, but not hovering.
2. **Create "launch pad":** Bag hook by door, lunch spot in fridge, everything needed in consistent locations he manages.

**Adult behavior change:**
- Instead of: "Time to get dressed. Go get your clothes. Put your shirt on. Now pants..."
- Do: Point to chart. "What's next?" If stuck: "Check your chart." Then walk away.

### Expect and Accept

- He WILL be slow at first. Possibly late. This is the price of learning.
- He WILL miss steps. Natural consequences (arriving without lunch = hungry) teach better than reminders.
- He WILL feel frustrated. This is the productive struggle of growth.
- YOU will feel anxious. This is your work, not his.

### Signs of Success

- Child checks chart without prompting
- Routine completes without adult in room
- Child problem-solves forgotten items independently
- Adult feels increasingly unnecessary

### The Montessori Perspective

Your son is not incapable - he has been trained to wait for external prompts. Every reminder you give confirms to him that he cannot do this alone. The solution is not more reminding; it is removing yourself and trusting him to rise to the challenge.

"Help me to do it alone" - but he cannot say this if you never give him the chance to struggle.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Maria Montessori** expert persona. Use it whenever dependency has developed and independence must be cultivated - in parenting, teaching, management, or any helping relationship.
